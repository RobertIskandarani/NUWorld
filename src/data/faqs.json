You can pay more for your transaction to be processed quicker or You can pay less for your transaction to be processed slower. Whilst you can choose to manually adjust the Gas Price (measured in GWEI). NEVER CHANGE THE GAS LIMIT. The gas limit your wallet gives you is more than sufficient to make a simple transaction."
